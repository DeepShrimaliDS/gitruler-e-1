# GitRuler Section C

This repository is section C of the [GitRuler exercises](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-exercises).

In this exercise we will learn about moving and removing files within a repository and telling git to ignore a set of files.

At any time you can run gitruler to check your progress. From the command line run:

`java -jar <path to gitruler.jar>`

For more information on running gitruler look at the [project repository](https://github.com/rcraggs/gitruler).

## Instructions

1. After cloning the repository change into the director on a [command line](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3337/command-line-interface-cli).
2. Run gitruler to initialise the exercise.


## Creating and Switching Branches

In this section we'll work with [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

1. There is a branch in this repository called "new-shop" which is used to plan the expansion of the fruit and veg shop to having multiple sites. [Switch to this branch](https://githowto.com/navigating_branches).
